  StoryText: "\nNow, You are quite baffled and think of a plan to land the plane
    so that everybody could be saved, you tell your old friend to distract everyone
    and you would go and talk to the airport authority by going into the cockpit
    and then the plane would land ... but there is a problem ... it's not that easy
    .... What do you do now?\r\n1. Talk to your friend [ everyone would suspect it]
    \r\n2. Think of a different plan"
