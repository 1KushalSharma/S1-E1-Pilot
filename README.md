This is my First text game !! A basic text game with choices to the user to progress the story 
Below is a sample scene from the game if you win it !!

And here is the link incase you wanna try the game: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/my-1st-basic-text-game

Also, this is just a basic text game where the user is presented with 2 choices and each outcome depends on the choice!! The storyline is complete garbage but still I would be grateful if you guys try the game and give feedback!!

Also the game can only be played on a pc and not on a mobile phone!
Thanks :)
